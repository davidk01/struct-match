# Match

Basic pattern matching for Struct types.

## Installation

Add the git path to your gem file and use the gem by requiring 'struct-matcher/match'.

## Usage

Example directory has a simple example to start with and the entire library is small enough to be digested in one sitting so reading the source is another good way to get started.
